Types of Software applications
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
a. Desktop applications
b. Web applications
c. Distributed applications
d. Mobile applications
e. AI applications
f. IoT applications
g. 2D and 3D applications

Note::
Desktop application     : No communication with internet

Explanation
===========
=> Suppose we have a hospital, we don't have branches
=> Now we need to track about doctor login|logout time, which all patients have come today and to which doctor we have assigned, we need to track about the
   patient status.
=> For this to track i would prefer building applications which would be used locally in our machine, such applications are termed as "Desktop applications".
		note: This type of trend is gone.....

			eg: notepad,paint,calculator,......


WebApplications
Distrubuted application : using app/browser with the help of internet if the interactions happens then it is web/distrubuted applications.

Explanation
===========
=> Assume i need to take an appointment with doctor in "Apollo Hosptial".
=> To take an appointment,now first check the internet connection and open browser and type the webiste of apollo(but not good opening in browser)
=> Trend now is install an apollo app[using the app all the details will be a part of that app so it is user friendly]
		eg: netflix,flipkart,amazon,myntra,.....


Mobile application      : calculator,calendar,gallery,....

AI applications         : chatgpt,siri,googlehome,amzaon alexa

IoT applications        : smartwatches,smartband(Internet of Things-> help of sensors it tracks how many calories burnt)

2D and 3D applications  : Gaming applications[Bike shown on Screen, where we click and it shows accelarte and u play games]

=========================================================================================================================================

With the help of our course we can build webapplications and distrubuted applications.
Using UI full stack with React we can build "Webapplications and Distrubutedapplications".
		eg: netflix,youtube,spotify,instagram,....
