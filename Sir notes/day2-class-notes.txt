Q>  What is Internet?
Ans. Internet is a wide area network that connects computers all over the world.
     Internet makes information available any time,any location and from any device.
     First computer network is "ARPANET" introduced by US-DOD[Department of Defence] in early 1960's
     			[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]
     To use internet during those days we need to learn protocols like SMTP,FTP,.....
     The main problem with internet is "No restrictions", so to avoid this tim berner lee introduced "web".

What is Web?
   A portion of internet with restricted acess.
   Tim Berner Lee(father of web) introduced the concept of Web.
   Web Standards are maintained by W3C(www.w3.org)[World wide web Consortium] and whatwg(http://whatwg.org).
   Darkweb -> not everyone can access[It is illegal way of acccessing the web]
   Currently WebVersion is "WEB-3".

Every webapplication is known as "3 tier application".
Database tier     :: It is a location where data is present.
Application tier  :: It is a location where the application is hosted.  
Presentation tier :: It is a location where we access and use the application.

As a full stack developer we will work with 3 layers
a. Application layer
b. Database layer     
c. Presentation layer :: UI Developer role(HTML,CSS,JS,JQuery,Bootstrap,....)
