Hyperlinks in HTML
- Link is clickable text, picture or graphic that navigates the user to any specified location when clicked.
- Hyperlink is clickable text, picture of graphics that navigates over “Http”.
- Hyperlinks are required to design navigation in website.

syntax: 
	<a> text|pitcure|Graphic </a>
	<a href="path"> text|pitcure|Graphic </a>

Note: 
=> According the Web Designing standards every website must have a proper navigation mechanism.
=> User must able to reach to any topic just with one click.

- HTML Hyperlinks are created by using “Anchor” Element.
- Anchor is designed by using “<a>” tag.
- Hyperlinks in website are classified into 2 types
	o Intra document links
	o Inter document links

Intra document link
- It is a hyperlink that handles navigation from one location to another within the page.
- User can navigate to any location within the page.
- In order to navigate to any location within page, you have to define unique reference ID for the target element.

Ex:
<h2 id=”electronics”> </h2>
<div id=”footwear”> </div>
<img id=”pic”>
- The anchor element uses “href” attribute that specifies the target location.
- “href” will set the specified path in “URL”.
- You can refer any ID by using “#”
Syntax:
   <a href=”#electronics”></a>

	http://localhost:5540/site/page.html#electronics  :: URL(Uniform Resource Locator)

	page.html#electronics : URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)

FAQ: What is the difference b/w "src & href "?
Ans. <img src="">
     <a href="">

src = "It is a getter(it is used to get path)".
href= "It is a setter(it is used to set path) and appends to URL".

Note: 
a. <a> element can only set the path,    so it requries "href" as the attribute.
b. <img> element can only get the path , so it requires "src" as the attribute.

intradocuments without scrollable
=================================
=> To highlight the content we go for css class called "target".

Note: CSS provides a "target" class that identifies the target container and sets the effect dynamically.
      This is used when we don't have much information to scroll.

- It also refers Hyperlink which can invoke email and call clients.
- Navigation can be to
	o File [word document, presentation, pdf]
	o Email Client
	o Mobile Dial application
	o HTML Page
	o URL
  

Note:
- Every file that you configured as target in Hyperlink can’t open in browser. 
- Files require special plugins to open the content and show in browser.
- If plugin is missing on not available then the linked file will be downloaded.
- target can be pdf file,image,etc.. which can be opened but if the target is audio,video or some word document it can't open
  because browser doesn't have plugin for that.
- To know which files can be opened by browser and which plugin is available in browser can be checked by "Javascript" programming.

FAQ: 
a>How to download any file through a link without opening it in browser?
Ans. We can use “download” attribute for Hyperlink.(given from HTML5)
Ex: 
<a href="../docs/cssdemo.pdf" download="" >CSSTutorial PDF</a>
	<!--Downloads the file with the name same as that of the link name :: cssdemo.pdf-->

<a href="../docs/cssdemo.pdf" download="csstutorial" >CSS Tutorial PDF</a>
	<!--Downloads the file with the name as given in the download name :: csstutorial.pdf-->


Link to URL
===========
=> You can link to any website or URL or any specific resource present in the server.
=> When we link the url we need to make sure that is configured with proper "protocol" and "domain" name.
eg
 <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Shop to Amazon </a>
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/physicswallah">Physics Wallah </a>

Link to Application
===================
 => We can create a hyperlink that can invoke the application which is running in your device.
 => You have to make sure that the relative application is already installed on your device.
 => Mostly commonly linked applications with anchor elements are 
		mail,skype,telephone

syntax: 
  < a href="mailto:@...">Email</a>
  < a href="tell:+91...">Call </a>


FAQ: How to open link target in a new Tab?
- Usually, the link target opens in the same browsing tab.
- You can define link with “target” attribute with value “_blank” to open in a new tab.

Syntax:

FAQ: How to open link target in a new Window?
  - You have to use JavaScript “window.open()” method for hyperlink.

Syntax:
   <a href="javascript:window.open('../Images/shoe.jpg','Nike','width=500 height=400')"> Nike Casuals</a>

Note: 
a. String means "",Inside the double quote if we want to write a String then we need to go for " 'string' ".
