HTML Page Structure
+++++++++++++++++++
 => Every HTML file must have static extensions called ".html or .htm"
 => Every HTML page starts with documentation declaration from HTML5 version.
 			<!doctype html>
	It is a indication to the browser engine that i am using latest features of HTML, if we don't specify the doctype then the
	browser engine understands the HTML has "HTML4" version.

 => Every HTML page must have a documentation scope, It specifies the start and end of the document in browser.
 		eg: <html> 
			document scope
		    </html>
    eg#1.
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	document-1
	</html>
	<html>
        	document-2
	</html>
	     Note: If some changes needs to be done in document-1, then it creates a problem because browser does the below things
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	document-1 document-2
	</html>

=> Every document scope must have "lang" attribute.It is used to define language for the web page content.
	<html lang="en-IN">
	<html lang="en-US">
		eg:: amazon.com (USA) , amazon.in(IND)

=> Every document scope has 2 sections at high level.
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
        	<head>

        	</head>
        	<body>
                
        	</body>
	</html>
